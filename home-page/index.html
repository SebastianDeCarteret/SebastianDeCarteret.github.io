          Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Seb and I am a
          software engineering apprentice at Barnett Waddingham, a leading
          independent UK professional services consultancy. I work on full stack
          solutions, building websites for internal use but also for pension
          customers. I am passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly
          solutions for various domains and industries.

          I have a keen interest in coffee, cycling and paddle boarding. Coffee
          is not just a drink for me, but a science and an art. I love to
          experiment with different beans, roasts, grinds and brew methods to
          find the perfect cup. Cycling is my way of staying fit and having fun.
          I like to cycle long distances and challenge myself with different
          terrains and speeds. I have also upgraded my bike with some aero bars
          to improve my aerodynamics and comfort. Paddle boarding is a relaxing
          experience that allows me to enjoy the nature and the water. I find it
          very calming and refreshing to paddle on a lake or a river.
